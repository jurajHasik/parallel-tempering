PROGRAM LIBRARY OF THE BOOK: "COMPUTER SIMULATION OF LIQUIDS"
BY M.P. ALLEN AND D. TILDESLEY, CLARENDON PRESS, OXFORD 1987.

These programs originally appeared on microfiche in the book
"Computer Simulation of Liquids" by M. P. Allen and D. J. Tildesley,
published by Oxford University Press, 1987. They are made freely available
to members of CCP5, in the hope that they will be useful.  The intention is
to clarify points made in the text, rather than to provide a piece of code
suitable for direct use in a research application.  We ascribe no commercial
value to the programs themselves.  Although a few complete programs are
provided, our aim has been to offer building blocks rather than black boxes.
As far as we are aware, the programs work correctly, but we can accept no
responsibility for the consequences of any errors, and would be grateful to
hear from you if you find any.  You should always check out a routine for your
particular application.  The programs contain some explanatory comments, and
are written, in the main, in FORTRAN-77.  One or two routines are written in
BASIC, for use on microcomputers.  In the absence of any universally agreed
standard for BASIC, we have chosen a very rudimentary dialect. These programs
have been run on an Acorn model B computer.  Hopefully the translation of
these programs into more sophisticated languages such as PASCAL or C should not
be difficult.
